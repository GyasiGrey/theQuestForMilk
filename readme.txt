**********THE QUEST FOR MILK - VERSION 1.9**********

The Quest For Milk was a game that I made for the 408 HoV contest. After it was all finished I decided that it was to ugly a game for me to have released in the first place, so I went on a mission to make it not ugly. Here is the result.

***Things changed***
Winners use 320*240
Battle system was given major overhaul
Menu system was overhauled and given a face lift
All maps were redone 
I made tiles (Shock and dismay!) and they don't cause spontanious human combustion!
A lot of things that should have been timer based are now timer based
I added a key config mostly because of the features of the new verge exe
Some dialog has been reworked, to show off my mastery of the english language (no hablo ingles)
Lots of various other random bugs that people knew about, and some they probably didn't
