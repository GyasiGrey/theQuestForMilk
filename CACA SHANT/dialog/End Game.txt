Acolyte: Noooo!!! It can't be!
(Acolyte runs from room)
Acolyte: Eaaarrrggghhhhh!!
(Keadik walks in)
Keadik: I have been looking for that villian for weeks now, I finally had the chance to run him through.
Keadik: Now what is the meaning of all this? Didn't I throw you all in the dungeon? Where are all the guards?
Thoush: Keadik... impeccable timing as usual.
Keadik: Wait... what did you just say...? Thoush?
Thoush: Yes my old friend, it really is me.
Keadik: With all the high tensions around the castle I must not of recognized you. Thoush, you certaintly look different from when I remember you.
Thoush: Yes well much has changed since then.
Alea: I guess he was never under under the control of the Acolyte.
Thoush: But first things first. I want to know where all the cows are.

(Everyone turns to look at the cow and screen fades to black.)
