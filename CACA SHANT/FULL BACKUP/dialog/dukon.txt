*after getting alea*
Guard: No entry without a pass.

Thoush: I don't have time for this.

Alea: Hold on Thoush don't get too excited, let me handle it. I'm sure we're both sensible people and I can talk him into letting us through.

Let Alea handle it?
	-Yes
		Alea: (to guard) Sir? If you would be so kind as to let us pass. We have urgent business with the Kingdom of Drolith. 
		
		Guard: Not my problem. No pass no entry.
		
		Alea: But all of our cows, they were taken somehow and the only way we can find out what happened is if you let us through.
		
		Guard: Like I said before. You're not getting through.
		
		Thoush: I don't think he's going to let us through.

		Guard: He seems do get it, apparently you don't.
		Alea (angry): Grrrrrrr (chants)

		Alea: Dark forces I summon thee
			Take those away that would do me harm
			And leave nothing but thin air in your wake

		Thoush: When did you learn to do that?!

		Alea: Oh you know I've always had some latent magical abilities.

		Thoush: Yeah but....

		Alea: Well.... we can pass now.

		Alea learned 'Banishment'!

	-No
		Thoush: I'll handle it my way.

		Thoush (to guard): Oh mister guard? You're not going to let us through?

		Guard: No.

		Thoush: Well I have 5 reasons right here that might just change your mind.

		*POW*

		*Guard is knocked out*

		Alea: Was all that necessary?

		Thoush: Yes.
