(Inside the Castle)
Alea: Don't you find it odd that none of the guards seem to mind that we're in here?
Thoush: Yes. If this was my command we'd have to fight our way through or at least stare menacingly.

(Approaching King's bedroom)
Thoush: This is a bad idea, we shouldn't be approaching the King's private quarters.
...
Alea: It's locked.
Guards: Halt intruders!

(Approaching Throne)
Alea: Isn't this where the King sits?
Guards: Halt! Noone approaches the King!
Thoush: Yes.

(Speaking with Keadik)
Thoush: Keadik? Keadik it's me. We need your help.
Keadik: What? I do not personally know any herder simpleton or his oddball companions.
Thoush: It's me Thoush!
Keadik: Do not insult an honorable name! He was a strong warrior and worthy of better memory than your tarnishing. Guards take them away!
