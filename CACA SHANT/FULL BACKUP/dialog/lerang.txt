Shop keeper: The boat with supplies only comes once a month so our inventory is light. Still, we might have what you need.

(Farm)
Thoush: Good Morning, Thyr.

Thyr: Oh hi Thoush, what are you doing in these parts. It's not like you to come all the way over here without a reason.

Thoush: Actually I do have a reason, a fairly good one actaully. When I woke up this morning to milk my cows, I found that every last one of them was gone. There were no tracks leading away, no holes in the fence and no sign of the cows or what had happened to them

Thyr: That is odd, because my cows have gone missing as well!

Thoush: What?! But the cows are the main source of income around here. Without them we're sunk!

Thoush: *sigh* Well getting excited won't do anything about it. You didn't happen to see anything weird happening last night did you?

Thyr: Sorry, no. I guess you could head to Drolith, they might know more there.

Thoush: I guess, but I really don't want to be back there.

Thyr: Back? When were you there in the first place?

Thoush: Huh? Oh......nothing, I meant I would have to pass through the mountans and all.

Thyr: It is a hassle, but the cows are our only source of income. Without them we're sunk.

(Nup pops in)

Nup: Like a redundant stick in the mud!

*WAP*

(Nup disappears)

Thoush: Guess I have no choice. In that case I'm heading to Drolith

Thyr: Good luck, I'll be waiting for you when you get back.

(Alea's House)
Alea: Thoush! What are you doing over here.....wait, something's wrong.

Thoush: Actually I was really thirsty and wanted some orange juice.

Alea: Why don't you have your usual milk?

(Nup pops in)

Nup: It does the body good!

Thoush: Because all the cows are missing.

Alea: And you didn't want to tell me because you knew that you would have to go to Drolith to get some answers. And you knew that if I knew what you knew I would go with you.

Thoush: Stop... trying to confuse me. Yes, and you'll just slow me down.

Alea: Uh huh. If I know you and your temper as soon as you walk out this door you'll run into some hoodlums who'll look at you the wrong way and before I can say "Milk helps to build strong bones" you'll have some broken ones.

Nup: But it does help to build strong bones!

Thoush: Alea, you are not coming with me and that is final! (runs out of the room)

(wait 1 sec)

*POW*

(Alea walks out and finds Thoush on the floor)

Thoush: ... Fine you can come with me. But only if you wipe that smirk off your face, and uh help me to point my leg in the right direction again.

Alea: (heals Thoush) Ah Thoush, what would you do without me?

Thoush: Well I still wanted some orange juice...

Nup: (stands in the doorway of Alea's house) And healthy teeth!

(Door slams shut) *SLAM*

Thoush: On second thought lets go find those cows.

Alea Joins!

(Other Farm)
Farmer: All my precious cows are gone! What am I going to do! *cries*

Farmer's Wife: At least dinner time will be much less confusing.  There was always a stampede when he called them to the dinner table, that may be because he named them all "Cow".

Lerang guy 1: A nefarious knave has pilfered my beautiful bovines!
Lerang guy 2: All of the cows gone! If only there was a hero and/or group of secondary yet equally important heroes who could find out who and/or what is behind this villany!
Lerang guy 3: I don't have a cow man.
